## Personal Note

Outside of development, Iâ€™m into design, learning new technologies, and building tools that people actually use.  
Currently exploring **serverless frameworks** and advanced **TypeScript patterns** to level up my backend workflows.

Thanks again for visiting â€” feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or commission something.
